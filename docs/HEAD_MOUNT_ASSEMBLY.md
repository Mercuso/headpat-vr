It's hard to find the standalone compact silicone brush
I use 2 brushes from the scalp massage device from Aliexpress https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005692082758.html
They can be easily taken off without damaging the device

## Assembly

Place the servo motor in the servo base as shown in the picture:

Secure the motor with screws. The screws should be included in the motor kit

![secure_servo](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/a20247c2-1d40-4588-b75c-12b8ba65b8fa)


Connect the motor to the microcontroller. Switch on the microcontroller and wait until it connects to the WiFi network

![connect_wires](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/f2142dd6-8ca2-4346-8d97-4526e906df92)


Once the connection is established, it should move the motor shaft to its initial position

Prepare the details for mounting the lever and its adapter
The lever and the small screw for the lever should be included in the motor kit as well

![servo_lever](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/79d4b754-95b9-4f71-96f4-39428aa679c9)


Put on the lever adapter. It is needed to attach the silicone brush

![lever_adapter](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/d4fb8f25-eae6-4f1f-94a4-dc11cb3bbee9)


Position the lever as it is shown in the picture below and tighten the screw

Secure the motor base on the motor mount with M3x10 screws. You can use 2 screws right now, and tighten another 2 later once you make sure that everything is done right and works correctly 

![secure_servo_mount](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/ae931b54-3f8e-4b69-b145-a85fd1a9b116)


Repeat the same for the right part

Tighten the M3X30 screw and align its tip with the hinge edge as it is shown in the picture. Then align the hinges of the servo mount with the strap mount and tighten the screw. Do the same on another side

Put on silicone brushes

Prepare the strap lid, the wires lock, and 4 M2x8 screws

![lid_components](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/325d1874-12ed-4b0f-b447-733375cccccb)


Put the strap mount in the comfortable position

![position_mount](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/9dbc554f-4345-4b29-b1a7-0a1050a41d6d)


Tighten 3 screws. Don't overtighten the 3-rd screw that fastens the wires lock, it should be loosened at the moment

![secure_mount](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/1abd9d47-97f8-43f9-aebf-7b1a91c1b6c5)


Guide the pair of servo motor wires through the wires lock

![guide_wires](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/580f45dc-7e2b-4c82-a1df-00c8a9cedd74)


Tighten the wires lock screws

![tighten_last_screw](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/927ca2bc-c8db-4f5c-ae6e-c599268a1b04)


The result should look like this:

![end_result](https://github.com/Mercuso/headpat-vr/assets/18481258/1dfbebba-5b7e-429d-8aae-1d4fc83554d1)

Once you make sure that everything works fine, you can tighten the remaining pairs of screws on the motors bases
