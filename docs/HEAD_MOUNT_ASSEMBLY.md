It's hard to find the standalone compact silicone brush
I use 2 brushes from the scalp massage device from Aliexpress https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005692082758.html
They can be easily taken off without damaging the device

## Assembly

### Clip mounting
put the plastic clip to the upper part of the headset strap system

insert the nut from the top and screw from the bottom  
Tighten the screw  
> [!WARNING]
> Be careful, don't damage the headset lenses!

Do the same on the opposite side

### Fixing the servo motors in the servo mounts
Insert the motor to the motor mount as it is shown on the picture
Pay attention to the motor shaft, it should be on the side that is opposite to the supports
Use the screws to fix it. The screws should be included into the motor kit

![servo-mount-step-1-5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7af3e982-42a2-42ef-a9bb-ec08caeb8b2a)

Position the servo mount on the clip as it is shown on the picture and insert the screw. Insert the nut from the opposite side. Slightly tighten the screw. The servo mount should rotate freely for the further adjustments

Connect the motor to the microcontroller. The left servo motor should be connected to P12, right - to P14. Connect the microcontroller to a power source and wait until it connects to the WiFi network

Once the connection is established, it should move the motor shaft to its start position

Put on the lever adapter. It is needed to attach the silicone brush

Put on the silicone brush
[servo-mount-step-1-11]

Position the lever as it is shown in the picture below and tighten the screw. This small screw should be included into the motor kit

Repeat same steps for the opposite side. All the parts relative positions should be mirrored horizontally

### Final adjustments
Put on the headset, move down the servo mounts and check the contact with your head during movements. Adjust their position by moving the clips horizontally and rotating the servo mounts. Take out headset and tighten the screws to fix the servo moounts
