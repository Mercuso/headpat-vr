# NodeMCU case assembly

## Tools
For this assembly, you need the following tools:
- Screwdriver
- 2.5mmÂ  Allen key

## Materials
For this step, you need to print all the parts listed here: https://www.printables.com/model/868170-nodemcu-v3-case
- nodemcu_case_base (x1)
- nodemcu_case_pins_cover (x2)
- nodemcu_case_wires_fixator (x1)
You're not limited in the microcontroller case choices, you can pick any or develop your own

## Assembly
Although it is possible to use dupont connectors to connect one of the motors to the microcontroller, I found mine too loose and soldered my connector from the pin headers from Wemos D1 mini board. You will see it in the pictures below instead of dupont ones  

Guide the wires as it is shown in the picture below. Choose the proper side using the wiring schematics from the main documentation

Put the microcontroller into the base and connect the wires

Position the pins covers

It's recommended to use a textile sleeve (8 mm diameter) to wrap the wires  
Guide the wires to the side opposite to the micro USB port, and wrap them into the textile sleeve (optionally). Secure one side of the pins covers with M3x10 screws

Finally, tighten another 2 M3x10 screws to the wires lock and secure another side of the pin covers with them. Do not overtighten the screws to avoid damaging wires

The result should look like this:
